Building this web page thing is the final step before sending out invitations to all of you!  I wanted to make something that streamlines tracking responses to our anniversary party that Ryan and I are throwing next year.  I am looking forward to celebrating with all of you who can make it out to see us.

I'll be posting more blog entries periodically as things get closer to the date. So feel free to check back later.
