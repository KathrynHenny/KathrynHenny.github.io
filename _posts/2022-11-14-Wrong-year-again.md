Last time I used vistaprint I accidentally left the date as the current year I was ordering in, not the future year it would be for the actual event.  Thank goodness I made this little web page with the accurate information.  Hopefully it will clear up any miscommunications with my friends and family who recieved paper invitations.

In other news we have already started recieving responses via the RSVP form!  I'm so glad this is a functioning tool for what I needed.  I have enjoyed the process of learning how to produce and add to this web page.  I look forward to making more blog posts in the lead up to the event.  

Please check back if you are interested in following along on the process with me!
